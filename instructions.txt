For the implementation, you can start with developing a simplified prototype as what was done in paper151, which allows a partitioned DNN to run sequentially to finish one inference.

For example, to replicate the timeline they show in the response letter, but only with one task (one DNN). Through this, you can also get familiar with the TensorRT & CUDA APIs.
